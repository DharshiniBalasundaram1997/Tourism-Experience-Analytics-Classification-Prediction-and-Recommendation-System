## 1. Regression:
### 🎯 **Use Case: Predicting Attraction Ratings**
> *📌 Objective*
- To predict the rating (1–5 scale) a user will assign to a tourist attraction using a regression model based on:
    - Historical visit data
    - User demographics
    - Attraction characteristics

> *🧠 Why This Matters*
- Travel platforms can enhance recommendation systems and satisfaction predictions.
- Tour operators can identify potentially low-rated attractions and proactively improve them.
- Personalized travel guides can rank attractions based on predicted satisfaction, increasing user engagement.

> *📥 Input Features*
- Category	                    Example Features
- User Demographics	            Continent, Region, Country, City
- Visit Details	                Year, Month, Mode of Visit (business, family, solo, etc.)
- Attraction Details	        Attraction Type, Location, Historical Avg Rating

> *🎯 Target Variable:*
- Rating (1 to 5) – A continuous numerical value representing satisfaction or experience.

> *🤖 Model Options:*
- Baseline: 
    - DecisionTreeRegressor
- Advanced: 
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - XGBoost , GradientBoostingRegressor, lightgbm


## 2. Classification:
### 🎯 **Use Case: Predicting Visit Mode**
> *📌 Objective*
- To predict the visit mode of a tourist (Business, Family, Couples, Friends, etc.) using a classification model based on:
    - User demographics
    - Attraction characteristics
    - Historical visit data

> *🧠 Why This Matters*
- Travel platforms can tailor marketing campaigns (e.g. promote family-friendly packages to users predicted to travel with family).
- Hotels can optimize offerings and amenities based on likely visitor types (business travelers need fast Wi-Fi, families want extra beds, etc.).
- Attraction organizers can plan resources and experiences more effectively (guided tours for couples, play areas for families).

> *📥 Input Features*
- Category	                       Example Features
- User Demographics	              Continent, Region, Country, City
- Attraction Characteristics	  Attraction Type, Popularity score
- Historical Visit Data	          Month, Year, Previous visit modes (user’s history), Visit frequency

> *🎯 Target Variable:*
- Visit Mode (categorical): Business, Family, Couples, Friends, Solo, Other

> *🤖 Model Options:*
- Baseline:
    - Logistic Regression (Multinomial)
- Advanced:
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - XGBoost Classifier
    - LightGBM Classifier


## 3. Recommendation:
### 🎯 **Use Case: Personalized Attraction Recommendations**
> *📌 Objective*
- Develop a recommendation system to suggest tourist attractions based on:
- user’s historical preferences

> *🧠 Why This Matters*
- 🏖️ Travel Platforms → Guide users to attractions they will likely enjoy → increase engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
- 🗺️ Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) → Identify emerging trends, promote targeted attractions.
- 🎯 Marketing Teams → Personalize campaigns based on user segments and preferences.

> *🤖 Types of Recommendation Approaches*
- 1️⃣ Collaborative Filtering
    - Recommend attractions based on preferences of similar users.
    - Uses user-item interaction matrix (user–attraction ratings or visits).

- 2️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
    - Suggest attractions similar to those already liked/visited by the user.
    - Uses attraction features: type, location, popularity, amenities.

> *🎯 Output*
- Ranked list of recommended attractions personalized for the user.
